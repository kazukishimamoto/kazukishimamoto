<h1>Hi thereðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I'm kazs.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing tennis, gaming, and watching TV shows. My skill level in Splatoon is around 2200-2300.
I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and I've visited Universal Studios Japan and Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in costume.
As for artists, I'm really into Mrs. Green Apple and BE:FIRST. In 2024, I attended my first Mrs. Green Apple concert.</p>
